# openVA-Pipeline

Automates the processing of verbal autopsy (VA) data from an ODK Aggregate server, through the openVA Pipeline middleware, 
and ending with a DHIS2 server (with the [VA module](https://github.com/SwissTPH/dhis2_va_draft)). VA data are analyzed
using the [openVA package](https://github.com/richardli/openVA) in R, which is demonstrated with code for an RShiny app.

## Getting Started
The `docs` folder (will) include:
- `setup.md` lists the software requirements and steps for getting the Pipeline up and running.
- `demo.md` steps for demonstrating the Pipeline.
